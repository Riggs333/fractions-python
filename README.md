# Add Fractions

Youâ€™ll build a library function that adds fractions as exact values -no converting to floating-point numbers!

For example: Input 1/8 + 3/8 = 1/2


## Test list
```
0 + 0 = 0
3 + 0 = 0
0 + 5 = 0
3 + 4 = 7

-3 + 1 = -2

1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5

1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6

3/4 + 5/8 = 11/8

1/6 + 4/9 = 11/18

-1/4 + 3/4 = 1/2
3/8 + -1/2 = -1/8

1/-4 + (-3/-4)  = 1/2

```
